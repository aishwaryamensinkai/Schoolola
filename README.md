The page is designed to be fully responsive across all devices, ensuring a seamless user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## Folder Structure

```bash
.
├── index.html           # The main HTML file
├── styles.css           # Main stylesheet for the landing page
├── script.js            # JavaScript file for interactivity (e.g., slider, toggle)

## Responsiveness

The page layout has been designed using CSS Grid and Flexbox, ensuring that it adapts smoothly across different screen sizes:

- **Desktop**: Full-width sections with more prominent typography and imagery.

## Interactivity
